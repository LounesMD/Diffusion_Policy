Diffusion policy is a visuomotor policy that leverages the latest advances in diffusion models to perform
complex manipulation tasks from human demonstrations.
More specifically, it involves denoising a sequence of actions to be performed, conditioned on the visual
observation of the scene. The use of diffusion provides a real advantage to the approach, enabling it
to surpass previous methods. In this study, we aim to understand what motivated the development of this
approach, reproduce the reported results, and explore its limitations.
